# Title: POS NCD Tracking Module for Patient and Product Management

## Context and Problem Statement

The POS NCD Tracking module needs to be implemented within the Odoo system to effectively manage and monitor patients with Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and ensure that relevant products are available and tracked in real time. The module should also integrate smoothly with other POS functionalities, allowing for seamless transactional and medical tracking in one platform.

## Decision Drivers

* **Patient-Centric Data Management**: Ensure patient profiles reflect NCD histories, current treatments, and relevant medical details.
* **Product Inventory Accuracy**: Track products with NCD capabilities, including stock levels, expiration dates, and product-specific notes.
* **Data Consistency**: Maintain reliable patient and product data integration within the POS system.
* **Ease of Use**: Ensure that the interface and features are user-friendly for healthcare providers managing NCD patients.
* **Scalability**: Design the module to support an increasing number of patient records and product entries as needed.

## Considered Options

* **Expand Odoo's existing POS Module**: Extend the base POS module with additional fields and features tailored to NCD tracking.
* **Custom NCD Tracking App within Odoo**: Develop a separate, customized app within Odoo specifically designed for NCD tracking to ensure separation of medical data and retail data.
* **Integration with External Medical Systems**: Use an API to connect the POS system with a specialized external NCD tracking system for medical records.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Expand Odoo's existing POS Module** because it allows for better integration with existing POS functionalities and maintains the simplicity of using a single system. This approach will also simplify data syncing and enable efficient management within Odoo.

### Consequences

* **Good**: Direct integration with the existing POS module, which reduces complexity and allows for more streamlined development.
* **Bad**: Increases the complexity of the POS module, requiring additional training for healthcare providers to use the new features effectively.

### Confirmation

Weâ€™ll confirm this decision through a beta test with healthcare staff and by evaluating data consistency and ease of use. Feedback from these tests will inform further refinements before the final rollout.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Expand Odoo's Existing POS Module

* **Good**: Simplifies data flow within a single system, maintains data consistency.
* **Neutral**: Training required to familiarize users with the new features.
* **Bad**: May create additional load on the POS module, potentially slowing down performance.

### Custom NCD Tracking App within Odoo

* **Good**: Allows dedicated NCD-focused design with optimized features.
* **Bad**: Requires more development time and effort to ensure smooth integration with POS data.

### Integration with External Medical Systems

* **Good**: Leverages specialized medical data management features.
* **Bad**: Adds dependency on an external system, which may lead to data syncing issues and added maintenance complexity.
